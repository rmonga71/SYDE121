not been plagiarized from other sources and has not been knowingly plagiarized by others.

Project: Weight Division Tool

Initial Program Steps:
1) Set initial value (valuegiven)
2) Declare a varibale for the number of 150 lb weights
3) Use the modulus operator to solve for the remainder after a whole number of 150 lb weights is used to fill up the initial weight given
4) Repeat for the remaining weight categories
5) Output the result in a coherent sentence with proper spacing.

/*
The first thing I did was run the code and test the 1048 value. I then confirmed the output number of weights for each category was correct by using my
calculator. I then started from -1 and tested values upwards. -1 lb weight given yields an output that you need "-1" 1 lb weights, so the weight given has to be a
positive number. I then tried inputting 1,000,000 and the code outputted the correct value. It is therefore safe to assume that the range of values that work is 0<x<infinity, where x is the weight given.
